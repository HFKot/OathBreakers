## About Us

[<Oathbreakers>](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/guild/us/aerie-peak/oathbreakers/) is a cross-realm & cross-faction World of Warcraft guild that focuses on *Heroic Raiding and Mythic+ keys*. But we also run Delves, old (xmog!) content, and whatever else Blizzard dreams up.

We are a group of veteran players from all around the US. Most members are in US timezones from Eastern to Pacific. Any region is welcome if our event times are good for you.

All of us are adults with various obligations but also a love of WoW that’s persisted through the expansions. We're chill in attitude with healthy aversion to drama and dogma. Our humor’s dry, the teasing’s friendly, and the vibe’s respectful. We like players who *play well with others*, not just play well.

Old-school WoW Dads, younger players, and everyone between who just want to kill bosses, run keys, and make bad jokes.
